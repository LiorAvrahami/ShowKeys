# ShowKeys
an application for when you can't see your keyboard, but can see your screen. when you press the initiator key combinations that can be customized, then a screan opens that blocks keyboard input and shows you what keys you are pressing.

I made this for someone that works while lying down, thus they can't view their keyboard whilst working.
